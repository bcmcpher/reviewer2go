A Montreal Brainhack 2023 Project

## Goals

 - We will be using the
  [COBIDAS](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3728)
  fMRI reporting standards and [Carp
  (2012)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2012.00149/full)
  to build a structured set of prompts with
  [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) that can extract the
  analysis parameters from a manuscript into a typed, structured data
  object.
  
  Ideally, this will help researchers review their manuscripts and
  editors to determine the state of manuscripts with a reliable and
  automated data parsing and extraction.
